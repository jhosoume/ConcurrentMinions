# Minions and Game Theory

Project developed in the Concurrent Computing Course in order to practice the use of concurrent techniques as locks and semaphores.

This program simulates the interaction of minions. A defined number of Minions is divided between two types: good and evil. Points are given to each type set in accordance with the interaction. The percentage of a type in each generation is calculated from its points in the previous generation.
