	abstract = {In many environments, multi-threaded code is written in a language that was originally designed without thread support (e.g. C), to which a library of threading primitives was subsequently added. There appears to be a general understanding that this is not the right approach. We provide specific arguments that a pure library approach, in which the compiler is designed independently of threading issues, cannot guarantee correctness of the resulting code.We first review why the approach almost works, and then examine some of the surprising behavior it may entail. We further illustrate that there are very simple cases in which a pure library-based approach seems incapable of expressing an efficient parallel algorithm.Our discussion takes place in the context of C with Pthreads, since it is commonly used, reasonably well specified, and does not attempt to ensure type-safety, which would entail even stronger constraints. The issues we raise are not specific to that context.},

	abstract = {The main goal of this research is to use OpenMP, Posix Threads and MicrosoftParallel Patternslibraries to design an algorithm to compute Matrix Multiplication effectively. By using the libraries of OpenMP, Posix Threads and Microsoft Parallel PatternsLibraries, onecan optimize the speedup of the algorithm. First step is to write simple program which calculates a predetermined Matrix and gives the results, after compilation and execution of the code. In this stage only single core processor is used to calculate the Matrix multiplication. Later on, in this research OpenMP, Posix Threads and Microsoft Parallel Patternslibraries are added separately and use some functions in the code to parallelize the computation, by using those functions multi-cores of a processor are allowed. Then execute the program and check its run time, then a timer functionis added to the code which periodically checks the time it took for the computer to do the parallelization. First the program is run without the Parallel libraries, and then with the OpenMP, Posix Threads and with MicrosoftParallel Patterns libraries code. Then program is executed for each input Matrix size and result is collected. Maximum 5 trials for each input size are conducted and record the time it took for the computer to parallelize the Matrix multiplication. Finally comparison of the performance in terms of execution time and speed up for OpenMP, Posix Threads and Microsoft Parallel Patternslibraries is done using different Matrix Dimensions and different number of processors},

This trend has caused overcoming the processor speed limit issues, by introducing multiple processor systems. In spite of hardware-level parallelism, the software has evolved with various techniques for achieving parallel programs execution. Executing a program in parallel can be efficiently done only if the program code follows certain rules. There are many techniques, which tend to provide variant processing speeds. The aim of this paper is to test the Matlab, OpenMPI and Pthreads methods on a single-processor, multi-processor, GRID and cluster systems and suggest optimal method for that particular system.},

It has been introduced by evolutionary biologists, anticipated in part by classical game theorists. In this survey, we present an overview of the many brands of deterministic dynamical systems motivated by evolutionary game theory, including ordinary differential equations (and, in particular, the replicator equation), differential inclusions (the best response dynamics), difference equations (as, for instance, fictitious play) and reaction-diffusion systems. A recurrent theme (the so-called `folk theorem of evolutionary game theory') is the close connection of the dynamical approach with the Nash equilibrium, but we show that a static, equilibrium-based viewpoint is, on principle, unable to always account for the long-term behaviour of players adjusting their behaviour to maximise their payoff.},

	abstract = {The subject matter of evolutionary game theory is the analysis of conflict and cooperation in animals and plants. Originally, game theory was developed as a theory of human strategic behavior based on an idealized picture of rational decision making. Evolutionary game theory does not rely on rationality assumptions but on the idea that the Darwinian process of natural selection drives organisms toward the optimization of reproductive success. Most of evolutionary game theory focuses on those cases where stable equilibrium is reached. However, the dynamics of evolutionary processes in disequilibrium is also an active area of research. In principle, evolutionary game theory deals only with fully symmetric games. Asymmetric conflicts are embedded in symmetric games where each player has the same chance to be on each side of the conflict. The mathematical definition of evolutionary stability refers to symmetric games only. Because asymmetric conflicts can be embedded in symmetric games, this is no obstacle for the treatment of asymmetric conflicts.},

The history of ideas about rationality is deeply contradictory at many turns. While there are theories of rationality that claim it is fundamentally social and aims at understanding and molding all facets of human psychological life, game theory takes rationality to be essentially located in individuals and to concern only the means to achieve predetermined ends. Thus, there are some thinkers who have made important contributions to this history who do not appear in the story of game theory at all, among them, Plato, Kant, and Hegel. There is, however, a clear trail to follow linking theories of instrumental rationality from Aristotle to the nineteenth-century marginalist economists and ultimately to von Neumann and Morgenstern and contemporary game theorists, that historically grounds game theory as a model of rational interaction.},

Linked to the ideas of the Prisoners' Dilemma and public goods, that work has provided important insights and lines of research. But it also has problems and limitations, which are explored in the paper. The anarchy approach stresses individual actors' choices and slights questions of how issues are posed and constrained. It takes preferences as given without exploring either the frequency of PD situations or the ways in which preferences are formed and can change. Many of the concepts the framework uses—e.g., cooperation and defection, the distinction between offense and defense, and the nature of power—are problematical. Issues of beliefs, perceptions, norms, and values also lead to a different perspective on cooperation.},

Depending on the environment, a minority of altruists can force a majority of selfish individuals to cooperate or, conversely, a few egoists can induce a large number of altruists to defect. Current gene-based evolutionary theories cannot explain important patterns of human altruism, pointing towards the importance of both theories of cultural evolution as well as gene–culture co-evolution.},
